# Projectiles (6)

This chapter is all about modelling specific scenarios when you throw stuff from one place to another.

# SUVAT Technique

When using SUVAT in this chapter, it’s best to write an arrow to indicate what direction you’re treating as positive. E.g. $\uparrow_+$ or $\downarrow_+$.

# Splitting velocities

In Chapter 5 we learnt about splitting forces into two components. Well… *We can do that with velocities as well!* It’s exactly the same between the two.

# Combining velocities

Just like you can split the velocities into x and y components, if you need to find a diagonal velocity, e.g. what velocity the projectile **hits the ground**, then you need to use PyTag to do it.

# Throwing an object

We always consider object being thrown **as particles**. This removes air resistance measurements and as such allows us to assume the following things:

- **Horizontal movement** - The object moves at a **constant rate** horizontally with **zero** acceleration. As such, we don’t need to use differentiation/integration *or* SUVAT - we can literally just use $\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$.
- **Vertical movement** - The object has a constant acceleration of $-g \text{ m s}^{-1}$.
- We call the distance from the starting point to the impact point the **range**.

We can evaluate the horizontal and vertical movement separate from each other.

# Parallel-related questions

One potential question you can get is one that asks you to find the point of the projectile’s path that’s **parallel** to a given line. This question is actually a similar/congruent shapes question, and may take a little bit of creativity to get right.
