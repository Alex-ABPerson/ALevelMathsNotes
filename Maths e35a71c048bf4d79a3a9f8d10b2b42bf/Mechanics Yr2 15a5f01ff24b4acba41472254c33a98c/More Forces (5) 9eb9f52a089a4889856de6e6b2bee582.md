# More Forces (5)

***Do not shortcut resolving the forces! Please follow $f=ma$ closely.***

# Breaking into components

When we want to calculate the x and y components of a force going in a certain direction, we can make a right-angle triangle around the force and apply basic trig to work them out. When you do this, the components will *always* each be either $F \sin x\degree$or $F \cos x\degree$and there’s one quick technique we can use for this.

If moving the arrow *towards* a given component is “closed” the angle, then the equation for that component is $F \cos x\degree$ - otherwise it’s $F \sin x\degree$.

# Inclined plane

An **inclined plane** literally just means… A slope. When an object is on a slope.

When you get inclined planes, what you should do is resolve everything *in the directions* relevant to the plane. So that could be diagonally down, or diagonally up. We can represent this resolving formula with the notation $R(\swarrow)$. 

In almost every single inclined plane question, you have to use the “breaking into components” knowledge to turn gravity, which acts straight downwards, into two components in the directions of our inclined plane. With a touch of alternate angles this is easy to do and we’ll find that, always, the effect of gravity *parallel* to the line is $F \sin x\degree$ while the effect of gravity perpendicular to the line is $F \cos x\degree$.

# Friction

Friction always applies a ***matching*** magnitude of force to the force you’re applying up to an object, up towards a given maximum threshold, at which it remains the same. So, if an object’s maximum friction is 5N, any push below 5N, the friction will *equal that*, and as soon as you go above 5N, the friction stays the same. It *does not* have a greater force than your push, as then the object would be moving backwards.

The maximum friction of an object is given as:

$$
F_{MAX} = \mu R
$$

(where $\mu$ is the **coefficient of friction** - a fractional value of “how rough” these objects together are, and $R$ is the reaction force).

If you think about this equation, it makes total sense. The greater the weight of an object, the greater the reaction force, so more friction with heavier objects. The greater this coefficient value, the greater the maximum force needed to overcome friction also.
