# Correlation (AS4+A1)

When describing correlation there are two key measures you must include: **Strength** and **type**. You can have **weak** correlation and **strong** correlation, and you can have **positive**, **negative** or **no linear** correlation.

<aside>
üí° Make sure that you always write **no linear** and not just ‚Äúno correlation‚Äù.

A **causal relationship** is where a change in one variable directly causes a change in another. *Just because variables show correlation does not mean they have a causal relationship.* If there is a correlation but no causation that‚Äôs known as a **spurious correlation**.

# Regression Line

A **regression line** is a line of best fit on a scatter graph. These are sometimes expressed through an equation in one any one of these forms $y=a+bx$, $y=ax+b$, $y=mx+c$ etc.

From the regression line it is possible to determine the **type** of correlation through the line‚Äôs gradient. If you‚Äôre asked to interpret the gradient value on the line, you need to say ‚Äúas x increases by 1, y increases by <gradient magnitude>‚Äù.

## Drawing it

You may have been taught in younger years that the correct way to draw the line of best fit is by simply putting an even number of points on each side, but this is **wrong**. What it‚Äôs really all about is  reducing the *error* between each side of the line. Which in practice works mostly the same. 

# Estimations

There are *two things* you can do that could lead you to an inaccurate estimation of value:

1. **Extrapolation** - Extrapolation is bad because you do not know what‚Äôs going to happen outside of the data set.
2. **Rearranging regression line** - It‚Äôs also bad to attempt to rearrange the regression line to find in the reverse of what you were given.

# Coefficient measurements

The **product moment correlation coefficient** is a measurement between -1 and 1 that describes the type and strength of **linear** correlation. Values below or above $\pm0.5$ are considered strong.

You can calculate this value with your calculator in mode 6. When you go into this mode, you‚Äôll have the ability to choose the type of regression - use `a + bx` and then fill in the table you‚Äôre given. Then press OPTN and you can calculate the value. The calculator will also work out the `a` and `b` values.

# Linearizing correlation

If data follows some kind of non-linear relationship, then the only way we can visualise its correlation (in A Level terms anyway) is by *linearizing it* with `log`. All we do is we take the thing it says it is, and we take the logs of both side of it. And then rearrange it a bit to get something in the form `y=mx+c`. We usually call this **coding data.**
