# Exam Analysis (MockSet1)

Extra note from some revision: If you’re stuck on the ranges question, try subbing in ridiculously high values…

# Pure 1

Accuracy: Two questions missed, unmissed: 42/75 (52%).

### Silly mistakes

- Q1: Mistyping into calculator
- Q3: Incorrect expansion.
- Q5: Misread question, missed a bit at the end.
- Q6a: Misread question, missed a bit
- Q6b: Forgot to write a variable on one sub between pages. To reduce errors, double-check both sides of an integral sub are algebraically similar?
- Q7a: Didn’t express in required form
- Q12a: Forgot to carry a constant translation up forward to the end
- Wasting time on mistakes in Q13

## Key Points

### Transformations

- Q4a: Graph ranges.
    - **Don’t forget** to consider asymptotes in the range!
    - The mark schemes list ***no working*** for range finding, it is *pure logic*, do it absolutely however you want!
- Q4b: You must **put the domain** **on an inverse function you’ve found - especially if you already know the range.
- Q4d: When asked to show something has no solutions, use the ***domain/range*!**

### Trigonometry

- Q7bi: If you see $\sin$ and $\cos$ together in an equation, **use R-conversion** to find min and max! Especially if it’s *in an R conversion question*.
- Q7ii: Optimize cast handling
- Q7ii: If asked to express to nearest minute, express as “hh:mm”!
- Q11i: Don’t forget to use the Yr2 identities in questions if possible.

### Algebraic proof

- Q8: Algebraic proof was absolutely awful. The solutions are so obvious!!
    - To show that a quadratic is always positive, *complete the square!*
    - When trying to algebraically find if an inequality is always true/false, you ***cannot*** eliminate the variable and compare raw constants. Find an alt path that doesn’t involve elimination.
        - It’s really easy to forget with inequalities that you can *add/subtract* each side to each other.
    - You are allowed to prove by looking for true/false scenarios, usually around the 0 boundary. (Probably by sketching I’d guess).
        - Some questions **must** be done like this.
    - Proof by contradiction is gone even though it’s easy.
    - For scenario-based proofs, remember that $\pi$ is irrational.

### Modelling with differentiation

- Q10: Really bad at getting the entry point to the question. Just… Think a bit?

# More Exam Analysis

**Mock Set 2 Stats**

- The wind direction in the large data set can be broken into 1/16ths when given in the form NNE.
- “Uniform distribution” is a goo distribution to mention if you’re not sure of one
- The large data set includes months **May** to **October**.
- Steps for **mean-based normal hypothesis testing**
    - Make $N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}n)$.
    - **Either:**
    - Model it with a standard normal distribution (which ends up leaving you with a ridiculous $P(X <$
- The equation for “given that” is not $\frac{P(C \cap D)}{P(C)}$ but $\frac{P(C \cap D)}{P(D)}$.
