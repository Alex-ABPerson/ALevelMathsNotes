# 8. Parametric

A **parametric** equation is one where we have a separate equation to describe the x co-ordinate and y co-ordinate at a certain point along a curve. It’s like saying “the x at this length along the curve will be this, and the y at this length along the curve will be this”. You can get some really complex looking curves described clearly with parametric curves, making it quite nice to work with sometimes.

In reality, parametric curves are really just a *different way* of representing equations, and it is technically possible to convert any parametric equation into a **Cartesian** equation, which is the regular thing we’re used to that’s in terms of `x` or `y` or both. But sometimes it can get beyond A-level to try and convert them, so we have to be able to do a few things to them directly.

# To Cartesian

To convert one into a cartesian equation, we can use simultaneous equations to get our third variable, say `t` as the subject, then combine it together. 

If you have trig functions in your equation, you will need to use *trig identities* to rearrange it. This could be $\sin^2x + \cos^2x \equiv 1$, or double-angle formulas, or just something else entirely - just think carefully here!

## Range & Domain

When you do this, you can also find the domain and range of our cartesian equation really easily using the two parts we came from

- The **domain** of our Cartesian equivalent is the **range** of the x portion.
- The **range** of our Cartesian equivalent is the **range** of the y portion.

When you convert parametric to cartesian equations, the **domain** of our cartesian-the 

# Solving

If you need to find an intersection with an $x=...$ or $y=...$ line, simply sub that value into that side.
