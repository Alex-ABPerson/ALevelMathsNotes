# 6. Recip Trigs

There are three *reciprocal* trig functions that you need to know. These are the normal trig functions but the reciprocal of them! These functions are $\cosec$, $\sec$ and $\cot$.

<aside>
ðŸ‘€ The third letter represents what trig function the denominator of the reciprocal fraction is, i.e. $\cosec x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$.

</aside>

You can find their exact values just by using the normal trig function and flipping it. And when youâ€™re solving with them, you can just rewrite them as necessary.

# Sketching

Sketching reciprocal trigs can definitely mess with your mind a little if youâ€™re not careful, but just think of it like this: 

1. All values at **1** stay the same, so your points on $\sin$ and $\cos$ are guaranteed.
2. All fractional values become top-heavy and head upward
3. All non-1 whole numbers become fractional values and head downward

Thatâ€™s it, really, itâ€™s really not that hard to sketch!

# Identities

We get two new identities when you introduce these functions, both of which you need to **remember** and be able to proveâ€¦ Even though they just come from $\sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$:

$$
1+\tan^2x \equiv \sec^2 x
$$

$$
1+\cot^2x \equiv \cosec^2 x
$$

These are both really easy to prove. Literally the only reason they exist is because youâ€™ve meddled with the OG identity to shove $\tan$ into it. In order to *get* a $\tan$ to appear in the equation, you have to force the $\cos^2 x$ under the $\sin^2x$ (or the other way around if youâ€™re looking for $\cot^2x$), which you can do like so:

$$
1 = \frac{1 - \sin^2x}{\cos^2x} \\
\space \\
1 = \frac{1}{\cos^2x} - tan^2x \\
\text{etc.}
$$

# Inverse Functions

There are a set of *inverse trigonometric functions* too. You can sketch these by flipping the x and y values of the trig functions, like you do with anything else.

But they do have some special names you need to know: $\arcsin$, $\arccos$ and $\arctan$.
