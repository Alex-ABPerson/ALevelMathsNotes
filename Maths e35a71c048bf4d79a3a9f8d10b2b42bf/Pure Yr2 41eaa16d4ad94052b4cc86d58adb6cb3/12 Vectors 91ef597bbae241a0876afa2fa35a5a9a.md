# 12. Vectors

In 3D spaces, we typically draw a diagram with our x-y planes flat and now a z value going upwards.

# 3D Magnitude

As we know, the magnitude for a 2D vector is just $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ through Pythagoras. We can take this idea into 3D simply by applying Pythagoras twice: $\sqrt{(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})^2 + z^2}$. Which simplifies down to:

$$
|a| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
$$

# Axis angles

When you have a position vector (vector from the origin), we have three formulas that link the angle that vectors make across each of the axis:

$$
\cos\theta_x = \frac{x}{|a|} \\
\cos\theta_y = \frac{y}{|a|} \\
\cos\theta_z = \frac{z}{|a|} \\
$$

These equations literally just come from basic $S^O_H -C^A_H-T^O_A$.

# Shape descriptions

One very common Year 2 vectors question is to **describe** what shape a given set of position vectors create.

**3-points - Triangles**

If you have three vectors, then they’re obviously forming a triangle and you need to describe whether it’s an equilateral or isosceles triangle. To do this, you **MUST** work out the magnitude of *all three* sides. If only two sides are equal in magnitude, it’s isosceles, if three sides are equal in magnitude, it’s equilateral.

**4-points - Other shapes**

If you have 4 vectors, then there’s a number of different shapes it could be, and what you need to do is **sketch** each one, *with your vector marked on the corners* and eliminate which ones it can’t be - below the shapes it could be and the rules for each:

- Square (all sides equal length)
- Rectangle (two sets of sides equal length)
- Parallelogram (same as rectangle…)
- Trapezium (one set of sides parallel)
- Kite (**No sides parallel**, two sets of sides with equal length)

# Making shapes

Another question you’ll get asks you to choose from a given set of points in order to *make* a shape. To do this, you need to sketch out each point roughly and figure out where the point will go.

⚠️ When you do these shape estimations, you **must** make sure it follows the sequential cycle of points they ask for.
