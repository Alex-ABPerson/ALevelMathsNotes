# Mechanics (8)

Mechanics is all about two different things:

- Motion
- Forces

These two interrelate a little bit and we have several techniques throughout for linking them together.

# Assumptions

It’s very hard to perfectly depict reality in our models, so we can make some assumptions about the objects in our models that can make things significantly easier. You literally just have to straight-up memorise this table and it is guaranteed to show up in one or two 1-mark questions in your exam:

# Motion Terms

There are three measurements relating to movement.

*Displacement/Distance, Speed/Velocity* (rate of change of displacement/distance) $m\space s^{-1}$, *Acceleration (How quickly velocity is changing)* $m\space s^{-2}$.

Negative acceleration is known as **deceleration** or **retardation**.

# Important Forces

**Weight**: The weight an object always goes *down*, and can be found by taking the mass and multiplying it by $g$. $g$ is always equal to $\underline{9.8}$.

**Reaction forces**: When one object rests on another, there’s a *reaction force* applied on it. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this reaction force’s value is the opposite of the weight or anything like that, it’s just straight-up its own thing and we tend to represent it as just `R` until we find it. This is always perpendicular to the object.

**Tension**: When something is being held up by string, we call what is *essentially* the reaction force of the object the tension.

There’s a bunch of other stuff like *upthrust* and
